# Dot Rotations

Consists of two grids of dots, one that is a transparent overlay layed on top of each other.  Dots are randomly distributed.  Click on it and the top layer rotates at the mouse click position.  This shows a series of concentric circles for about a second or so before the illusion disappears.
